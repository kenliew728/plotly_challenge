# **Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard**
### ***Background***

The purpose of the repository is to display the work of creating a dashboard to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. 


### ***How it Works?***
The user will select the test subject ID from a drop down menu and the dashboard will display the following charts:
1. Top 10 bacteria cultures found in belly button
2. The belly button washing frequency
3. Baterial cultures per sample

All the displays are interactive and will change when different ID is being selected. 

Here is the example of the dashboard.
